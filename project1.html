			<h1>HTML</h1>	
				<h2>Definition</h2>
					<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text MarkUp Language.It is like a skelton of a web page. It controls the structure of it. HTML is the main type of document on the web.</p>

					<span>HTML is made up of</span>
					<ul>
						<li>Text Content-what you see .</li>
						<li>Mark Up- descibes how it looks like.</li>
						<li>Refences to images and or videos.</li>
						<li>Links to the other pages.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This video</a> gives a good overview.
          			</p>
				<h2>TAGS</h2>
					<p>HTML is made up of Tags.They come in angled brackets. They usually come in pairs called, opening tags and closing tags.
					Images do not have any closing tags.They are called 'void tags'.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Element - An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. There are Inline elements,like 'span' which have a string like content as opposed to Block elements, like 'div' which are invisible blocks with content or other elements within them too.</li>
						<li>Attribute- This is a property of an HTML element.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the distinction well. </p>	
				<h2>Structure</h2>
					<p>HTML document has a structure, which is - the type of the document, a header and a body.</p>
					
					<div class="example">
						<p>For example, the structure of an HTML looks like this
						</p>
						<pre>
							<code>
						<!--The pre tag is preformated text.We are asking the computer to ignore the rules for the content in pre tag only by using &lt for < and &gt for >-->
&lt;!DOCTYPE html Swapna's Project&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Stage 1&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;This is how a basic structure looks like.
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;							
	<!--To have this text alligned to left in the browser,the same had to be done here too-->								 </code>
						</pre>
					</div>

			<h1>CSS</h1>
				<h2>Definition</h2>
					<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Cascading means most specific rule applied.This idea is known as <b>Inheritance</b>.The tree like structure is because of DOM-Document Object Model. CSS allows you to use specific syntax and rules to change how elements look on a page like the size of a font, color,background,position, etc.</p>

				<h2>How it works</h2>		
					<p>CSS is a code written to control the style of HTML elements through <b>Selectors</b>. There are element selectors, id selectors and class selectors. The declaration or declaration block in CSS is the section of a style rule that defines the styles to be applied.
					</p>
				<h2>Validation</h2>
					<p>In order to check any errors in your code, you could get it validated <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">here</a>.</p>

			<h1>Additional Information</h1>
				<p>Web Page - It is like a big box, which contains several nested boxes  or content like text, images, videos, etc. So if you look at any web page you would see a top box with a heading, called header, a middle box containing the body and the bottom box named footer.
				</p>
				<p>Repetition-The main benefit of avoiding repetition in code is to improve readability and code maintenance.</p>
